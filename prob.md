-[ ] Front Page
-[ ] what actually sets you apart? Dig deeper.
-[ ] Graphics aren’t in the middle of the window. I did a bunch of adjusting/resizing and I think they are just off a bit. Too far to the left (safari, Firefox, and chrome)
-[ ] Intro/Welcome/Resume - redundant. Each needs a reason to exist - more on these later
-[ ] Is there a secret coffee spill in the b/g or is my screen dirty?
-[ ] If it’s there, why? (i like it, i want a why)
-[x] If there’s a why, make sure there’s a reason. Like, if someone asked 'what's this about' you have an explanation.

-[ ] Welcome - prob needs a different title. Welcome can be on the main page if you want some intro copy. Aperture graphic = snapshot of what is on the rest of the page. Cover letter vibe. Make me want to learn more. Why are you even here? Who are you?
-[ ] Pic can be there but shouldn’t be the focal point. ~mysterious what do I really look like pic~ maybe
-[ ] Quick rundown of experience, education, goals, interests, and what sets you apart.
-[ ] This page should make me want to learn more about you. Interesting, intriguing. Why do I want to go back and click the other categories?
-[ ] No name as title. Something else. Opportunity to get a glimpse into your personality with a greeting.
-[ ] “Hello”, “Ahoy-hoy”, “You’re here. I’m queer”, “Welcome”, etc. Whatever you want your vibe to be.

-[ ] About
-[ ] Here’s the spot for the pic (you need non-wedding pics. i have a guy, you'd like him'
-[ ] Everyone has cats and dogs. You rescue and rehome, you love the lost boys. You want to fix the broken.
-[ ] Everyone has a wife. Relationships are boring and irrelevant. You have an analog to your digital. If it's included, make it an insight to how you work and thrive with and need different minds.
-[ ] Lifting weights is for chads. I heard you’re a nerd. Something like ‘I work out enough that I can keep up with my 3 pizza dinner regimen’ or ‘I stay in the same shape as my tiefling warrior’. Doesn’t have to be silly cause professionalism or whatever, but make it interesting. Like, why do you lift? Give me something to relate to if I’m a sad skinny boi that's hiring.
-[ ] Same with the computer thing. Good to mention, make it interesting. How’s your tinkering any different?
-[ ] Language: I get the play on language/languages and I like that, but I don’t love it since you only speak English. Not saying kill it, but just think about if it’s impactful.
-[ ] “I am not afraid to ask questions” - my favorite part of this whole dang site.
-[ ] Skills: I like this! I want all of these smaller to allow for some space between each logo. A tiny thing that shows you have some understanding of brand importance. Even if you don’t. Don’t nascar shit. I can elaborate with visuals, but imagine the side of a nascar with all the little logos on the tail end so smushed together you can't see any of them vs the MT DEW logo on the side with plenty of room around it.
-[ ] Speaking of skills, I love a list of things you know you can do living on here somewhere. Flex your shit.
-[ ] “Sucker for efficiency” - could you give a VERY short example? i like it even if you can’t. Might be more impactful if you can.
-[x] I don’t love the ‘X’ to leave the page. I want a “back” or 'main' or 'home' something representing that. You don’t want people cancelling you, you want them to go back TO YOU to find more.
-[ ] Oh shit it says CONNOR

-[ ] Projects
-[x] Intro should maybe say something about how you interact with each project instead of saying they are projects. Like, “click (ok, maybe not ‘click’ but whatevs) each project to view info and site.” Or nothing at all. Design should be intuitive, after all.
-[x] Also, when you click to the project page, I think there should be a preview at the top that you click to see it, then scroll below for deetz. My eyeballs go right past the linked text to the shiny stuff and then I can’t click it.
-[ ] Align title text - left justify with the rest of the page text
-[x] Opportunity to have fun w/ the background text. Eg: YIKES: ’Spooky’ ‘don’t scream’
-[ ] OR, stick with the same word as the title throughout
-[ ] Title/bullet spacing needs help. I can help.
-[ ] Hover text - consistency with capitalization. Maybe use punctuation?
-[ ] I have lots of copy edits. Happy to share them. Words are good, just grammar, punctuation, consistency type junk. Nothing crazy.
-[ ] Should projects open in new tab? I don't like that if you click out, your site is gone.
-[x] Can you make the whole project square clickable instead of just the title? I’ve hovered and it’s made an action and my brain sees the object as the click.
-[ ] I’d suggest consistency on hover graphics. They should all have them or none should.

-[ ] Resume
-[ ] Tell me what you did in each position-any mundane task can be worded to be relevant. (Eg: stocking shelves is ‘Ensured shipment accuracy by comparing item counts to invoices while maintaining inventory and sales floor merchandise to current level of customer demand to exceed sales goals and other levels of total bullshit’.
-[ ] I mean, it doesn’t have to be so try-hard, but it can be relevant or at least proof that you’re able to learn (and succeed in!) a wide variety of corporate and interpersonal bullshit.
-[ ] Even deeper into this, like just go the the army website and the ‘combat engineer’ job description is literally everything someone is looking for in a field that deals with creation and problem solving. Explosives are emotional clients, navigation and detection is seeing problems and communicating/solving them before they arise, etc etc etc. Use this shit.
-[ ] Education: the fuck are these? Give me some context about why it matters. This is the trouble with portfolio-based careers. You have to tell why your education is valuable (if it’s not an obvious degree). You have to tell them what sets you apart from some asshole 16 year old on an advanced STEM track. Why is your investment in education worth more of their money?
-[ ] Where’s your PT certification/program?
-[ ] Maybe link to the programs. Even if it’s redundant, then it links to a THING at a SCHOOL. Legitimizes the words.
-[ ] On second thought, I don’t think you need any intro copy. It is what it is, let your work do the work. Show, don’t tell.
-[ ] I don’t like ‘my history’. It feels dead. You want to project a story that’s being written. This is a snapshot of where you’ve been and where you can go, not a eulogy.

-[ ]Contact
-[ ] I think this needs to be all clicky graphics or your main contacts (email, phone) above the web links.
-[ ] Also, linkedin isnt….linked. in. oof.
